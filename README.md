## Description

I think I am finally getting the flow of building a webpage a little better after this project. I learned how to take smaller steps, create 1 variable at a time, add the event Listener to it if it's a button, work on the funtion and for loops that might go with it, and THEN move on to the next variable/ problem I am trying to solve! My tutor was a huge help this week with this process. It's a pretty basic site, CSS could use a lot of work, but it functions as was required and I can improve from here over time. This project pushed me WAY out of my comfort zone. I asked the learning assistant a LOT of questions. I grew from it!
